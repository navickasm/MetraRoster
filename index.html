	<h3>About this site</h3>
	<p>This website was created and is maintained by a Chicagoland railfanner. All <a href="./gen.js">code</a> was written, not generated. Any photos credited to "312Trains" are in the public domain, and you can use them for free however you want even without credit, although it is always appreciated. <b>All photos without a license obviously visible on the photo page ARE COPYRIGHTED and the original owner must be contacted for permission to use.</b></p>
	<p>My end goal is to have every single picture of every locomotive on this page be my own or in the public domain. This obviously isn't possible due to some locomotives being scrapped or unreachable (cough LTEX cough), but I hope to get as close as I can. If you want to support this endeavor, the best way to help is to go to the <a href="https://github.com/AbyssStudios/MetraRoster/issues/new?labels=photo&template=contribute-photo.md">GitHub page</a> and submit your photos under public domain there.</p>
	<p>If you have any corrections, additions, or retractions that you think should be made, open up an issue.</p>
	<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
